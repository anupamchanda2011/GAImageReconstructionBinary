# GAImageReconstruction
We have implemented a Genetic Algorithm that can be used for image regeneration. Our algorithm takes an image as input and
approximates the image using its components.Our algo works for diffrent dimensions and gray scale values.Intermediate results are also available form our algorithm.We have implemented our genetic algorithm code in such a way that our GA components(crossover,mutation,selection) can be used in other GA applications.

# Language and Tools
Python,Jupyter Notebook

# Libraries and Packages
Numpy,Matplotlib,Pandas,skimage,PIL

# How to run?
There are two file one is target image and other is .py file.Inorder to run download both py and image file. You can run it with diffrent file also. Just put in same directory of .py file and change image name in .py file. You can run it with different no of generations,populatio size etc.
